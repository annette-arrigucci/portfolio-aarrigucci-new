                <p>I'm Annette Arrigucci, a full-stack web developer focusing on ASP.NET MVC and C#. My technical skills also include JavaScript, jQuery, LINQ, SQL, HTML and CSS.</p>
                <p>I'm a recent graduate of Coder Foundry, a full-time, 12-week programming "boot camp" designed to simulate a real work environment. Through the course I've built projects using the Microsoft stack, including a household budget planner, software bug tracker and personal blog. You can view these projects along with some personal projects on the <a href="~/Home/Portfolio">Portfolio</a> section of my website. You can also take a look at the code for these applications on <a href="https://github.com/annette-arrigucci" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
                <p>Before my transition to web development I managed content for local news websites for eight years. While I worked extensively with technology and websites during that time, late last year I decided that I wanted to move in a new direction and take a deep dive into coding. This decision was based on changes in the news industry as well as the move with my husband to the Augusta, Georgia, area in 2015.</p>
                <p>My experiences at three news organizations were fun and exciting, besides opening my eyes to my local community and teaching me a great deal of skills. Some of the skills I learned include developing strategies to gain audience, managing a team of digital producers, managing professional social media accounts, gathering web analytics, publishing photos and videos to the web, writing news articles and copy editing.</p>
                <p>While there are many differences between the worlds of journalism and technology, there are also many areas of intersection. I believe journalism and technology are both tools that can be used to make the world a better place. As a programmer I hope to make people's lives better through useful, well-designed technology tools.</p>
                <p>When I'm not working I'm reading for fun, hanging out with my husband, on the phone with my family or planning my next travel adventure.</p>
